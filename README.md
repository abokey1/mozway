## Why this repository ?

<p align="justify">This repository is a tribute to the amazing work of <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/users/16343464/mozway">mozway</a> (üìçüåç, Mare Tranquillitatis), a Python enthusiastic on StackOveflow. Mozway's answers (<i>in particular to pandas questions</i>) are known for their class, finesse and most importantly creativity, making them in my opinion : the GOAT (Greatest of All Time) in the world of pandas.</p>

<p align="justify">As someone who started answering questions on StackOverflow recently with <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/users/16120011/timeless">this</a> profile, I became a big fan of mozway and their exceptional skills in data manipulation and analysis using python and decided to create this repository. Their answers on StackOverflow have been a source of inspiration for me (and for sure, for too many others), and the reason why I started learning pandas (<i>seriously in July 2022</i>) and answering questions on the platform. This repository serves as a way for me to share mozway's knowledge and expertise with a wider audience and to give back to the community and to try to explain (<i>more in details</i>) every mozway's answer. Here you will find a compilation of some of the answers that embody the mozway mindset, providing valuable insights and solutions for advanced pandas questions. Each question/answer (<i>presented in the form of Jupyter Notebooks</i>) includes explanations and resources for further understanding.</p>

## The moz'***way***

<p align="justify">Mozway is not just a python enthusiast, it's a lifestyle, a way of thinking, a mindset, a creative approach to data manipulation and analysis. It's about being different, thinking outside the box and approaching problems with creativity. It's about being fast, precise and paying attention to the small details. It's all about finding the best way to solve a problem, it's all about the moz'<i><b>way</i></b>.</p>

## Future plans

<p align="justify">This repository is a WIP (work in progress), and in the future, I plan to turn it into a Python library built on top of pandas, providing a comprehensive set of tools and functions for data manipulation and analysis. Also, a book could be written to go more in depth about the subject. In order to achieve this goal, I would probably need help from anyone interested in this project, whether it be in the form of contributions, suggestions or feedback.</p>

Happy Coding !
